<h1 style="font-size:200%">A Reduntant Mini Autobiography about Myself</h1>


<p style="font-size:110%">I was born in the Netherlands and raised in the Finger Lakes region of New York.  Furthermore, I have lived, studied and/or worked in Ecuador, Italy, South Korea, Switzerland and Poland. After earning my MFA in Sculpture from the Maryland Institute College of Art I had a residency in Zurich, Switzerland in 2007. I currently live in Sunnyside, Queens and work as an ESL (English as a Second Language) teacher in Flushing. </p>

<h2><b>It is getting late and I am not sure what to write...</b></h2>

<p style="font-family:verdana;font-size:110%;color:green !important">This is my second paragraph in a lovely shade of green. It contains a few links to some of my artistic projects. Check them out if you are curious...
Hopefully with the skills and knowledge I learn at DBC I can make a better website!!!
