    <p>I made this piece by recording my head slowly moving in different directions. Then I projected this on my girlfriend&apos;s head and gave her verbal instructions to match her movements to my head&apos;s movements. I excluded the verbal instructions because they were unnecessary and distracting.  </p></span></span>
