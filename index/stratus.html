    <p>2006, steel, milk, PVC tubing, fountain pump, video projector, DVD player, 12&apos; x 5&apos; x 4&apos;</p><br>
    <p>This video documentation of the work shows the screen onto which the image is projected. The imagery is various layers of cloud footage edited so that the clouds move in opposing directions. A two-inch deep pool of milk forms the screen, which circulates to the ceiling via a fountain pump and drips into the pool. The milk captures the image and the drips interact intermittently with the imagery to create a contemplative piece. </p></span></span>
