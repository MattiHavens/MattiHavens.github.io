    <p>2012, Color Video, 16 minutes 15 seconds</p><br>
    <p>The interviews from <i>Portraits of the American Dream</i> seek to show some of the reasons people come to this country and how they have enriched our culture by their presence and knowledge. </p>
    <p>The two interviews I have selected show two different motivations and experiences of the American Dream.
    </p>
    <p>Jay, Ha Yoon Lee is a talented Korean-American artist who has exhibited internationally and nationally. The following interview tells her personal story of why she came here and some of the difficulties she has overcome.
