    <p>2007, feathers, thread, video projectors, DVD players, 8&apos; x 13&apos; x 6&apos;</p><br>
    <p>This video sculpture consists of a mass of feathers suspended by threads and two projectors. The feathers fade from a flat more regular arrangement on one side to a more random dissipated mass on the other side. The flat  side acts as a screen to receive the narrative display of regularly changing still images, while the other more sculptural side receives the slowly moving abstract video imagery. As a result of the textural quality of the screen the images are more abstract. The images tell the story of the life and death of a rooster. The mesmerizing sculpture emphasizes the contrasts between moving and still image, abstraction and representation, and sculpture and video. </p></span></span>
