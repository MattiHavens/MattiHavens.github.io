    <p>2006, Color Video, 5 minutes 50 seconds</p><br>
    <p><i>Simon</i> is a magic show/vaudeville type performance in the style of silent movies. At first the audience is acknowledged but then ignored, as it becomes an increasingly humorous and sinister conflict between man and fish. As is it becomes obvious that the fish will not cooperate positive encouragement is used and degenerates in to wicked punishment. </p></span></span>
