    <p>2012, Color Video, 8 minutes 52 seconds</p><br>
    <p>After the US National Anthem duet I invited the audience to break open a large American flag pi&ntilde;ata. The pi&ntilde;ata was constructed of cardboard boxes and contained a wide variety of things. Inside the pi&ntilde;ata were flags of various sizes, Budweisers, Coca-Cola, root beer, a Book of Mormon, toy soldiers, Tootsie Rolls, Hershey&apos;s kisses, apples, Jim Beam, Jack Daniels, Campbell&apos;s Chicken Soup, scratch-off lotto tickets, change, dollar bills, a map of the USA, a globe, cigarettes, lighters, a football, a baseball, a statue of liberty, a &quot;I Love NY&quot; t-shirt, Utz potato chips, condoms, a Playboy magazine, a deck of cards, Tabasco sauce, peanut butter, a toy taxi, a toy Camaro, Burger King crowns, and a Pez dispenser. </p></span></span>
