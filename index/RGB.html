    <p>2006, metal, vellum, wood, paint, glue, video projectors, DVD players, 8&apos; x 6&apos; x 5&apos;</p><br>
    <p>I used three projectors and three screens installed in a triangular formation. They are divided into alternating one-inch wide strips allowing for the projected imagery to be combined in an abstract but still distinguishable manner. Each screen has a different color projected on it with Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) corresponding to video imagery of Fire, Water and Sky. In making the piece triangular and suspended, it permitted the viewer  to enter the work and become immersed in the meditative imagery. The triangular framework and altered screens makes for three levels of viewing; the interior of the triangular screen formation, it&apos;s exterior and also the walls of the surrounding space. </p></span></span>
