    <p>2012, Color Video, 15 minutes 46 seconds</p><br>
    <p>The interviews from <i>Portraits of the American Dream</i> seek to show some of the reasons people come to this country and how they have enriched our culture by their presence and knowledge. </p>
    <p>The two interviews I have selected show two different motivations and experiences of the American Dream.
    </p>
    <p>Ninoslav Randjelovic is an award-winning independent documentary filmmaker who has shown his films concerning Kosovo around the world. His story is complex and discusses politics effects upon the freedom of the press.
