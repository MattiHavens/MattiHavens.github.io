    <p>2007, vellum, wood, paint, video projectors, DVD players, 8&apos; x 6&apos; x 6&apos;</p><br>
    <p>The piece consists of three cut vellum paper screens that intersect in a manner similar to an asterisk (*) with three video projections. The screens are cut into strips, which allows the projected imagery to be combined in an abstract but still distinguishable manner. One projection is of forest scenery, one of urban/city scenery and the other riverside/suburban scenery, hence the title. The physical movement of walking and the movement of the camera are different for each video loop. </p></span></span>
