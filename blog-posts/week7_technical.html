      SQL Injection is a way for malicious hackers to get into a SQL database and alter and/or steal information. After seeing how it is done and how commonly it has occurred I am surprised it can still happen. As a matter of fact as stated by <a href="http://www.veracode.com/security/sql-injection" target="_blank">Veracode</a>&quot;With over 20% of all web vulnerabilities being attributed to SQL Injection, this is the 2nd most common software vulnerability.&quot;

      It seems pretty easy to do, just follow the example below and try it out yourself! Just kidding use your knowledge for good not evil!!
      </p>
    <br>
      <p>
      If the server code is like below and requires the user to input information that will go directly into a SQL statement it allows the malicious user to manipulate it.

      <br>
      <br>
      <p>
      when asked for the UserName the malicious user would enter something like;
      </p>
      <br>
      <img src="http://mattihavens.github.io/blog-posts/Shot_2.jpg" width="400" height="80"
    alt="Shot_2">
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>
       Then the following would be true;
      </p>
      <br>
      <img src="http://mattihavens.github.io/blog-posts/Shot_3.jpg" width="400" height="80"
    alt="Shot_3">
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>
      The SQL above is correct code. Then it would return all the rows from the table Users, since WHERE 1=1 is always true. Likewise the malicious user could use any true statement 2=2, etc...
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      If the Users row contained names and passwords or other sensitive information then the malicious user could cause a lot of problems. As you can see it is a rather simple and ingenious way of accessing information.
