    <h3>
       Diversity
       </h3>
      <p>
      Diversity is a hugely important and sometimes tricky topic to discuss. I am sure it has been debated a million times. Nonetheless I will bring it up again.
      </p>
      <p>
      It is also a very broad topic that could be written about at great length. From my point of view one of the biggest problems with a lack of diversity is a lack of different viewpoints. In general (and I am generalizing a lot) a group of young white males will probably have somewhat similar viewpoints on things and likewise come up with similar solutions to problems. A more diverse group will naturally bring different ideas to the table. Perhaps, this will bring about more disagreements but in the end the solutions will be stronger and more well-thought out. Also, thinking &quot;outside the box&quot; (I hate using this over-used cliche, but sometimes it is appropriate) is more likely to occur from people who come from different backgrounds. Creativity is frequently fostered by diversity.

    <h3>
       Solutions...

      <p>
      This is not a problem that will be solved over night, seeing as it also involves a broad cultural shift that addresses sexism, racial bias, education and broader cultural trends. As I said before it is a big and complex problem. Fortunately, the <strong>USA</strong> is a very diverse and creative country so that the change in the tech industry (in terms of diversity) should and could occur here.

      How to address this problem? That is very difficult considering you must consider the very sensitive issues mentioned above including sexism, racial bias, education and broader cultural trends. All of these topics are extremely provocative and get people riled up. In the end there are no easy solutions and it will take some time.  
      </p>
      <p>
       I am glad to see that <strong>DBC</strong> is quite diverse. It is encouraging that DBC is actively aware of and trying
       to address this problem.

      Below is a link to a <strong>New York Times</strong> article that I found regarding sexism in the tech industry. I was flabbergasted (wow, I haven&apos;t used that word in a while) to see that people would have the nerve to make such an app in this day and age. Check out the article to see what I am talking about. Also, the graphs and tables presented in the article are quite revealing.

     <p>
     The below link lists diversity as reason number 6 in the "Top Ten Problems Faced by Business". Clearly it 
     isn't only a problem faced by the tech industry. Their description of the problem is short but concise.
