    <h3>
       Gregorc's Mind Styles
       </h3>
      <p>
      I am split between being a <strong>Concrete Random</strong> and <strong>Abstract Sequential</strong>. I disagree with some of the descriptions on the chart about Abstract Sequential people, it says that it is hard for me; &quot;to work with those of differing views&quot;, and &quot;not monopolize a conversation&quot;. I enjoy working with others that have differing views and have worked with and continue to work with people of diverse backgrounds and differing views. On the second point I am a better listener than talker and rarely monopolize conversations. It isn&apos;t in my nature. Besides that I agree with the other descriptions on the Abstract Sequential chart. I also agree with all of the descriptions on the Concrete Random chart. 
      </p>
      <p>
      This information has helped me become more self-aware and confirms some things I have already discovered. I love to experiment with code and keep trying things until it works. Reading over code and analyzing how everything works together is also extremely helpful. This reflects the analytical side of my Abstract Sequential character. 
      </p>
    <h3>
       Fixed vs. Growth Mindset 
       </h3>
      <p>
      From the Fixed vs. Growth Mindset article I realized that I greatly value the kind of thinking described by the Growth Mindset. Our minds are extremely pliable and with some of the strategies outlined there we can learn to do most everything. I imagine most people at DBC have a Growth Mindset or wouldn&apos;t be at DBC to begin with.  
      </p>
      <h3>
       Time Management 
       </h3>
      <p>
      From the studies of time management I read about the <strong>Pomodoro Technique</strong>. The way of managing time as outlined there is extremely useful. With DBC we always have various tasks and assignments to do. Usually it is difficult to complete them in a sequential order. Towards this end I use a variation of the Pomodoro Technique and dedicate chunks of time to specific tasks so I don&apos;t spend too much time with one task or another. For example my deadline for this writing assignment is 7:30, so 15 more minutes to go!   
      </p>
      <h3>
       Conclusion
       </h3>
      <p>
      If I can employ all of these techniques together and study and learn in different ways then I will retain and be able to employ my knowledge more efficiently. These studies of thinking styles and time management have already helped me become a better learner.
