<p>I reviewed three very different websites http://www.wimdelvoye.be/, https://www.spotify.com/us/, and http://www.fifa.com/</p> 
<p>I am an artist and like the work of Wim Delvoye, a provocative artist from Belgium. Some of his work is rather provocative and risque but interesting nonetheless. The website is pretty funky as well and has the feel of a video game, like Simcity, with buildings you can click on and enter. This site gets the viewer to move around a lot, getting the user to move from one corner of the site to the other.</p>
<p>Recently I have been addicted to the world cup and therefore have been checking the FIFA website for the schedule, game times and competetion info. It is utilitarian in design  and easy to use with clear graphics and simple functionality. I wouldn't say it is my favorite but one that I have been using a lot and quite convenient.</p>  
<p>The last site that I have included is Spotify. It is rather commercial and tries to appeal to yound "hip" people. I use Spotify a lot and find it fun and easy to use. Like Wim Delvoye's site it moves and visually pulls the viewer down the page. Also I really like the floating layered effect of this page with elements that move down over eachother.</p>
