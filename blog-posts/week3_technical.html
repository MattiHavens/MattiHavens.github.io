      <h1>The Popularity of Javascript</h1>
      <p>
        There are threee main reasons why Javascript is so popular.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>Javascript is easy to learn</li>
       <li>Javascript is powerful</li>
       <li>Javascript is ubiqitous</li>
       
       </ul>
    <h3>
       Javascript is easy to learn
       </h3>
      <p>
      It is fairly easy to learn and get working on a website quickly. This lets users develop programs and ideas and implement them quickly and see the results live. Javascript is also easy to edit and debug.
      </p>
    <h3>
       Javascript is powerful
       </h3>
      <p>
      It is simple to add to your programs and loads onto the browser so only requires a functioning browser to work. Like some other languages it has an object oriented structure. It is used mostly on the client side freeing up the server for other tasks. People are using it for more advanced tasks and pages are becoming more Javascript dependent. 
      </p>
      <p>
      Javascript is <strong>asynchronous</strong>. Asynchronous means that Javascript, unlike other languages, does NOT need to process information sequentially. It can work on various tasks simultaneously, it does NOT need to finish one task before moving onto the next.  
      </p>
      <p>
      Javascript is easily extensible and employs some very useful libraries like jQuery, Prototype and Dojo. These libraries allow users to easily manipulate pages with just a few lines of code.
      <h3>
       Javascript is ubiqitous
       </h3>
      <p>
      Most browsers have some form of Javascript. The exact figures are debatable but approximately 95% of your user&apos;s browsers will support Javascript in some form. 
      </p>
      <p>
      Until around 2009 Javascript was mostly used for the DOM. Now Javascript is being used to write physics simulations, 2d graphics, 3d graphics,  audio processing and synthesizing, real-time video processing, codec decoding, etc. So it is increasingly being used for almost everything!
