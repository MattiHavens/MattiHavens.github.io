       What is a class?
       </h3>
      <p>
      There are many ways to discuss and make analogies to classes. I will use the analogy of bicycles. We could say that a bicycle is an instance of the class known as bicycles with various subclasses, road bikes, mountain bikes, etc. Once you make a class and all of its methods you would have a &quot;blueprint&quot; from which you could make thousands of bicycles. 
      </p>
      <h3>
       Example
       </h3>
      <p>
      The following Bicycle class is one possible implementation:

    <h3>
       Benefits
       </h3>
      <p>
      One of the benefits of Object Oriented Design is that to make a change to the design or &quot;blueprint&quot; you would only need to make a change to a couple elements rather than needing to change everything. In a non-Object Oriented Design model if you change one thing you would have to change everything else that follows that change as well. The change and its effects would cascade through the entirety of the code, and you might need to change many lines of code. 
      <!--<h3>
       Time Management 
       </h3>-->
      <p>
      This also addresses the idea of specialization and separate functionality, so if you make changes to one it would NOT affect the other. As <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">Wikipedia</a> humorously stated through Richard Conway,
      <br> &quot;So, for example, one would know that the square root function was separate from the launch missiles function, and a change to one could not affect the other.&quot;

       Conclusion
       </h3>
      <p>
       In all situations I have felt that pairing has been beneficial. When you are more advanced it reinforces your knowledge, because by explaining concepts and code to your partner you are solidifying your expertise. And when you are behind everything is a beneficial learning session. Or when you are at equal levels it is an even exchange. I have paired with various people but have had repeat sessions with various individuals that I have gotten along well with.

      Below is a link to a <strong>New York Times</strong> article that I found regarding sexism in the tech industry. I was flabbergasted (wow, I haven&apos;t used that word in a while) to see that people would have the nerve to make such an app in this day and age. Check out the article to see what I am talking about. Also, the graphs and tables presented in the article are quite revealing.
