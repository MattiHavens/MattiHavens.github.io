      <h1>Conflict</h1>

     <p>
     I avoid conflict and arguments as best as I can and am adverse to overly emotional and dramatic people. I am also a private person who doesn&apos;t like to share my personal problems very much. For those reasons this was a difficult blog for me. I kind of hope that nobody reads it...

     One conflict I had recently was with my mom. I live in NY City, my mother lives in Maine, and my father lives in Syracuse, NY. A mini geography lesson and personal history is necessary. To visit my dad requires a 5 hour bus trip while a trip to my mom&apos;s requires a plane trip plus an hour and half drive for her to pick me up from the Portland airport. Anyhow, she gets quite jealous when I visit my father. I am able to visit him more frequently because he is closer and the bus is cheaper. Also, I grew up near there so a lot of my family and some friends still live there further motivating me to visit there more frequently.

     She called ten days ago and complained about the fact that I wasn&apos;t able to visit this summer and gave me a guilt trip about how we (my brothers and I) neglect her and that nobody has the time to visit. This was also prompted by her jealousy and dislike of my father. Normally, I try to be nice and appease her but this time I became quite angry because I was stressed with work and DBC challenges. I guess I took it out on her a little.

     The last time we spoke we didn&apos;t even discuss this issue and had a nice conversation about other things. I suppose we both preferred to forget about the angry discussion we had. The situation still hasn&apos;t resolved itself and probably won&apos;t unless I move closer or find more time/money to visit.

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
     How does it all relate to the Compass of Shame? I think we both verbally &quot;Attacked Other&quot; and then after the fact resorted to &quot;Avoidance&quot; and denied that the incident even took place. But the question remains, how do we resolve it? I think communication is important and my mother and I continue to communicate regularly. Hopefully in the future we will both have a little more free time and money to make visits happen more frequently.
