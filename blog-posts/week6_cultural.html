      <h1>Diversity Threat Discussion</h1>

     <p>
        For my blog this week I have copied the amazing discussion that Samuel Spread initiated with his blog. Jess Heron responded to his original blog post with a thoughtful critique which in turn started a lengthy discussion that touched upon many important issues in regards to this provocative
        topic. Below I have copied the text from Samuel's blog (with a link to the original post) and then each subsequent section copies the text
        from the August Stars Community Page. 
     </p>
     <br>
     <p>Both Samuel Spread and Jess Heron have granted me permission to include their comments. Otherwise I followed the philosophy of <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper"id="logoLink"><strong>Grace Hopper</strong></a>, who said, "It's easier to ask forgiveness than it is to get permission." If you don't want me to include your comments please let me know and I will

      <h2>Samuel Spread's original blog post</h2>

      <strong>Damn You, Stereotype Threat</strong>              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;           July 31.2014
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
In 1995, Steele and Aronson published a study that formally introduced the stereotype threat. The researchers gave a difficult portion of the GRE to African-American and European-American participants. They attempted to indirectly evoke the cognitive availability of a stereotype in the participants by describing one of the tests as "diagnostic of intellectual ability". They found that African-Americans scored lower on this test. They attributed this underperformance to the risk that an individual felt that doing so would confirm as self-characteristic the negative stereotype about one's group. The negative stereotype in this study presumably being that African-Americans perform more poorly than European-Americans on standardized tests.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Hundreds of studies exhibit the effects of stereotype threat on performance, and it transcends race to gender, age and so on. The key that makes this threat damaging appears to be in the awareness of the stereotype. An individual commented on The Atlantic article entitled "Thin Ice: Stereotype Threat and Black College Students". He claims to be an African who recently came to America, and so had not been exposed to the negative stereotypes regarding intelligence that are directed at African-Americans. As such, he had been able to "disregard [his] group identity as a factor in most roles". He had no conception of how his "blackness" affected him academically, so it did not affect him.
</p>
<br>
<p>
The preceding anecdote offers a helpful point when considering how to attenuate the stereotype threat. While awareness of stereotypes weighs on an individual in certain situations, perhaps awareness of the concept of the stereotype threat is enough to mitigate it to some degree. In a 100-level psychology or sociology class, you might learn about a number of biases or predispositions that seem to come pre-loaded in the human brain. Some serve as helpful heuristics, but many can be harmful to making the best judgments (i.e. stereotyping). I find that learning about and becoming aware that these notions can sneak into cognition is paramount to optimum critical thinking, from big-time resolutions down to every-day decisions.
</p>
<br>
<p>
As individuals, we will have a tough time directly combating prevalent stereotypes, but we do have some control over how these stereotypes affect our performance. By understanding that stereotype threat "is a thing", we can identify the situations wherein it is likely to rear its ugly head. When we find ourselves in those situations, we are prepared for our fears because they are familiar, and we can gain confidence in our abilities in spite of what we perceive the stereotype to dictate of our aptitude. The stereotype may be alive and well, but the threat we feel that apprehends our flair is but within ourselves.

      <p>
Samuel Spread, it's so important that we recognize how powerful we are to change ourselves, and I really like how you spoke to the individual capacity we all share to shape our own lives.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Still, I'm having some difficulty with your post. I wasn't sure how to say this, but your blog this week seems to offer an easy fix, 'chin-up' approach to stereotype threat, especially if my presumption that, if your life as a white male has been anything like mine, you have not, by and large, directly experienced, as the receiver, said threat. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
Of course, I don't mean to presume, as your life is something about which I have no knowledge. But, you didn't speak to that reality, and instead use the royal pronoun, we, in your suggested course of action. Am I, as a reader, to assume your kinship with those who have fought such battles, or just take your advice as my voice, writ large?
</p>
<br>
<p>
You must see the fallacy that in your conclusion as it appears to derive from the idea that not-knowing about a cultural prejudice is the equivalent to simply mustering the will to un-know it-- do you really think that is true? 
</p>
<br>
<p>
I&apos;d like to encourage you to resist the urge to endorse easy fixes that are neither logical nor about your own shared experience, however that avails itself. I hope that my comments are useful, even if challenging.

<p>
Jess Heron, you write a thoughtful critique. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
First, a distinction. The stereotype threat, unlike prejudice, is an internal manifestation. Notwithstanding, it is most likely a byproduct of prejudice (are we using prejudice and stereotype interchangeably?). But ultimately, it is something that an individual can seize and own.
</p>
<br>
<p>
You characterize my proposal as an oversimplified easy "fix" to the stereotype threat. I agree that what I write sounds straightforward, but it is by no means easy to execute, nor a complete solution. It is a first priority. If we (yes, we) seek to improve and succeed, it starts with an honest perception of ourselves. How can we achieve this if we are distracted and overcome with concern for the way others perceive our capability? 
</p>
<br>
<p>
I use "we" not because I claim to know prejudice, but because I believe we share the capability to self-determine, to an extent that is greater than we may initially realize, especially in the face of external negative pressures. Let's start with what is actionable and harness our own power. Nobody will do that for you.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Perhaps you disagree with my points, and perhaps you hold in question my credibility in such matters because I am a white male. But, I disagree with you that I should abstain from discussing this. I look forward to reading your post.
</p>

<p>
Thanks, Sam! And thank you for your dialogue.
</p>
<br>
<p>
You're right, firstly, I should be more careful in my use of prejudice and stereotype, as they're not interchangeable-- thanks. I'm not suggesting you should refrain from using your voice-- you might read more carefully. I'm suggesting you are neither speaking logically, as stated, nor from an experience that is referenced as your own. So what's left, but a rather inchoate intellectual (re)action, devoid of your sincerity that might guide it to ring true to the heart? I'm not suggesting you're an insincere person, please know I'm addressing the need to speak from a deeper place.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Without being subject to the stereotype threat, how can you know how easy or hard it is to overcome? Of course, you can't, no matter how similar or dissimilar it may be to other feats of will and perseverance. Again, as you didn't reference your own experience, it's within reason to conclude you are out of your depth (of experience). What's lacking in my view, is flexibility about consideration, a maturity to recognize that maybe you don't know, or some humility about the topic-- I think those would be well received, and mostly, be good for you.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Let me try this tack another way which exposes myself. For me, if someone takes the time to express their difficulty with my thoughts or actions, I don't typically get great results if I assume it's on me to elucidate them to their wrong perceptions. Not that I don't have a long history with that behavior, I most certainly do-- and, I'm probably heading down that path right now, running the embarrassing risk of being hypocritical. That said, any tension you are experiencing (or 'should' be if your sensitive) with my and others' responses to your writings (I noticed some pushback to your previous cultural blog) are coming from a tension in you. Maybe that's ok with you, as you clearly have a sharp mind and a strong will; but, I wish more for you (and this world), including some greater ability to expand your views to include those that are not your own, to see the value in humility over presumption and prescription.
</p>
<br>
<p>
You seem to be quite supportive of the notion that we, as individuals, can build ourselves into whatever we choose-- you won't find me disagreeing about that point, and I think you make it well. It's really not my place to say more, as I can't change you any more than I can the weather, and I see that you are articulate, but are not appearing to hear, or listen to, the points made. But, there's this-- it is worth attending to the fact that your peers are offering you some navigation born of a different vantage. Will you exercise the magnificent power of surrender and trust, or grasp ever tighter to the captain's wheel? What type of person will you make yourself to be? I wish the best for you. :-)

      <p>
Samuel Spread I have to speak to your post so there won't be confusion when we meet in person. Your blog post was shocking. In a bad way. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
I will not debate your beliefs, but I will ask you to consider your audience. You are offending people.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Jess Heron provided the kind of thoughtful feedback I am too furious to express at the moment. To dismiss it with such little true reflection is a mistake.

      <h2>Samuel Spread's Response &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       August 1, 2014</h2>
      <p>
Good morning,
</p>
<br>
<p>
Thank you for another well-written and thought provoking response. I think you're right: there is a tension. I'm going to attempt to articulate it. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
When I see a topic such as the one for this week's cultural blog, I am fascinated and eager to discuss it. I truly appreciate a great discussion about a tricky subject. The way I go about evaluating said subject matter, as with any decision or debatable thing, is with a logical approach. I like to break it down into bite size chunks, evaluate cause/affect relationships, identify what's controllable and what's left up to chance or external factors, and execute my decision or opinion about a potential solution accordingly. What I did in my blog post was no different.
</p>
<br>
<p>
In taking this strictly logic and admittedly theoretical approach, I neglect to actually recount a personal anecdote. Not only did I find it not necessary given my particular approach, but I frankly did not come up with something worthy of writing about, especially to an audience that probably has something exemplary.
</p>
<br>
<p>
So, what's left as you may see it is an insincere, inchoate intellectual reaction to a problem for which I am not privy to give counseling. The way I see it is a sincere, perhaps not-fully-baked, intellectual start to a discussion about a problem that, like anything worth discussing, has the capacity for logical delineation.
</p>
<br>
<p>
That being said, I want to make very clear that I do not mean to trivialize the struggles and experiences of anyone. Nor do I claim to identify with those things on the same level. Rather, I'm attacking the problem in a vacuum realm of "if A, then B, therefore C", devoid of the very real emotions that discussing these types of issues typically brings. Idealistic? Yes, to a point But I think it's important in looking at any problem to have a logical framework in place, and I think this feature is all too often swept away with instinctive emotion, and fear of appearing ignorant or offensive. 
</p>
<br>
<p>So that's the approach I aim to bring to he table. Just because I attempt to place strict boundaries on the scope of my own argument, I by no means attempt to exclude the feelings and views of others from this discussion or consideration. In fact, these things are welcome, requisite and wonderful. The tension that results perhaps stems from the perceived implications of my writings to undertake the latter, which I do not see at first, because I intend for for my writing to be taken at face value, as one mutually inclusive piece of the puzzle, and nothing more.
</p>

      <p>
So glad we're having this conversation. When I saw stereotype threat was on the dock this week I was surprised, excited and nervous all at once. +Jess Heron - thank you for being so thoughtful with your words. I'm more the type that gets so moved by these discussions I can shut down in a silent, disheartened, rage, so I appreciate folks who speak up! 
</p>
<br>
<p>
Samuel Spread - I think the biggest take-home message is that these conversations of threat and stereotypes and prejudice are not bound by logic by definition... so an attempt to apply logical solutions, while admirable, can fall short. But I appreciate the conversation and your explaining where you're coming from - that's the only way we'll ever get to understand each other in this crazy world.

      <p>
I find the hostility to +Samuel Spread's post puzzling. He did not choose the prompt. This is the prompt that was assigned to us and DBC asks us to post it here. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
Granted, my experience is probably closer to Samuel's than say a woman of color, but I thought for a topic as sensitive and complicated as stereotype threat, he handled it as respectfully as to be expected considering his experiences.
</p>
<br>
<p>
At no point did I feel Samuel brushed aside the experiences of others, nor attempted to force onto the reader his thoughts as a supreme reality. Samuel is not offering us a solution to the problem. The post merely seeks to point out that awareness of the phenomenon can be the first step to dismantling it and overcoming it. I strongly agree with that.
</p>
<br>
<p>If you disagree, feel free to say so, but I really do not understand the antagonism, and personally it makes me not want to discuss the subject further. And I hope we can agree that is not what we are aiming for.

      <h2>Isaac Noda's Response &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       August 1, 2014</h2>
      <p>
I'm going to go out on a limb here and defend Sam... 
</p>
<br>
<p>
I got a very different message when I read Sam's post.
</p>
<br>
<p>
I didn't feel like Sam was saying, "chin up, get over it", or "toughen up, and it'll be fine". Nor was he denying the existence of the stereotype threat.
</p>
<br>
<p>
He also does not claim his solution is absolute, or complete:
</p>
<br>
<p>
"perhaps awareness of the concept of the stereotype threat is enough to mitigate it to some degree."  - he says perhaps, it can help, to some degree, not do this and the problem is solved.
</p>
<br>
<p>
"we do have some control over how these stereotypes affect our performance" - we have some control, not total control
</p>
<br>
<p>
I have to agree with Sam that there could be some power in just being aware of the stereotype threat. Part of this post's prompt reads: "If you don't think you've ever felt it, can you imagine some groups that might? What could you do to help others in that situation?"
Through the readings, I got the sense that the stereotype threat is something that has been unfortunately entrenched in our society, and has real, detrimental effects on several minority groups. I also got from the readings (not my personal experience), the sense that the stereotype threat seems to have a deep grasp on an individual's self consciousness/identity.
</p>
<br>
<p>
"...who showed in several experiments that Black college freshmen and sophomores performed more poorly on standardized tests than White students when their race was emphasized."
</p>
<br>
<p>
There are two things at play here:
1. A long history of racism/prejudice in America that has had terrible effects on minority groups - this is very real, inexcusable, still existent today, and very difficult to completely eradicate.
</p>
<br>
<p>
AND
</p>
<br>
<p>
2. The test taker having some sort of reaction/self-doubt/sense of threat from this emphasis on race. This, is not all on the individual; this is tied to the the first thing. How could it not be? BUT, if there were something very actionable to be done at the moment, I would have to say it'd be the individual using awareness of the stereotype threat to TRY to circumvent it's negative effects, to some degree (not completely). Sam didn't say this is easy, and he did not say this is the end of the road. He says this is something real that an individual could TRY, that MIGHT help.  
</p>
<br>
<p>
A lot of criticism seems to be directed at the fact that Sam is a white male. You're right in that it's very likely a white male has experienced very little, if at all, of the stereotype threat.
</p>
<br>
<p>
I wonder, if he didn't use the word "we", and added one line in the post that said: "although I've never personally faced the stereotype threat, I'd like to hypothesize on a possibly helpful idea", would that make the post less offensive? 
</p>
<br>
<p>
Also, if Sam should not be able to TRY to offer a logical solution, what SHOULD he have written? "I have no idea what to do", or "it's not my place to think of something that might be insightful"? What good would that do?
</p>
<br>
<p>
Back to the prompt:  "If you don't think you've ever felt it, can you imagine some groups that might? What could you do to help others in that situation?" 
</p>
<br>
<p>
I think Sam tried to throw an idea out there, and although there are some things that could have definitely been clarified, I don't think Sam wrote something evil or arrogant here.
</p>

      <p>
FWIW, the research on stereotype threat does include situations where white males are made to feel threatened and perform worse as a result. So beyond being a race thing, or a gender thing (which, in my opinion, is more prominent in this field of ours), it's a human thing. There's got to be some beauty in that, right? 
</p>
<br>
<p>Regardless, I hope we do continue to have this conversation in the greater sense of the word. It's never easy and sometimes feelings are mistakenly hurt... But it's always worth it.
