     Asking good questions is extremely important in all aspects of life and is an extremely important part of communication in general. Not only is the question important but who you ask is also important. In my life I have found sage advice and good answers to my questions from various wise people in my life. When making important decisions it is a crucial part of my decision making process.

      <h3>Should I Stay or Should I Go?</h3>

    A good example was when I was considering whether or not to attend DBC. I had many questions about it and I asked and listened to the advice of many people. Not only did I ask my family but I also asked people who worked in the field and might know about DBC&apos;s reputation. Obviously, most of the answers were positive and encouraging and I look forward to starting class full-time tomorrow.
