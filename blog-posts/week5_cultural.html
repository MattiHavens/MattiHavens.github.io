       Reflections on Pairing
       </h3>
      <p>
      One thing I have done that has helped me for my pairing sessions is to preview the assignment before meeting with my partner. Not with the intention of getting ahead, but to think about the problem and various ways we could solve it. Sometimes my brain needs to warm up to a little bit and think about the problem before we meet. 
      </p>
      <h3>
       Challenges
       </h3>
      <p>
      One problem I have encountered a couple of times is being at a lower level of skill and knowledge than my pair. I felt I wasn&apos;t able to contribute as much as I would have liked to. For my first couple of GPS sessions I was only able to sign up for sessions on Thursday evenings. Because of my work schedule I am not able to dedicate much time to the challenges and assignments until Thursday evening or later, so that when I had the meetings I always felt that my pair was way ahead of me and leading the session. It made me feel a little awkward and inferior, like I was mooching off of the other person&apos;s knowledge and skills. However, I also learned a lot from my pair and enjoyed the hands-on learning tutorial. 
      </p>
    <h3>
       Ideal Sessions
       </h3>
      <p>
      I feel my best pairing sessions have been when there is an equal give and take of knowledge and both people get to share in driving and navigating equally. My best sessions have felt like working and coding conversations with an organic sharing of ideas. 
      </p>

      I will make an analogy with skiing (I like analogies). It is always more fun to ski with someone who is at your level, otherwise you are either in front waiting for the person to catch up (boring) or you are trying really hard to keep up and frustrated by your own slowness and lack of competency. I have been in both situations and neither are fun for extended periods of time. 
      </p>
      <h3>
       Conclusion
       </h3>
      <p>
       In all situations I have felt that pairing has been beneficial. When you are more advanced it reinforces your knowledge, because by explaining concepts and code to your partner you are solidifying your expertise. And when you are behind everything is a beneficial learning session. Or when you are at equal levels it is an even exchange. I have paired with various people but have had repeat sessions with various individuals that I have gotten along well with.

      Below is a link to a <strong>New York Times</strong> article that I found regarding sexism in the tech industry. I was flabbergasted (wow, I haven&apos;t used that word in a while) to see that people would have the nerve to make such an app in this day and age. Check out the article to see what I am talking about. Also, the graphs and tables presented in the article are quite revealing.
