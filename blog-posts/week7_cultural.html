      <h1>Values that are important to me</h1>

     <p>
        I chose a broad selection of values that are important to me.
     </p>
     <p>
        And to the right is the degree to which I live up to these values.

     Creativity and being creative is extremely important to me. Its most obvious manifestation is my diverse artistic practice; <a href="http://mattihavensportfolio.blogspot.com/"id="logoLink">http://mattihavensportfolio.blogspot.com/</a>, but creativity also manifests itself in other aspects of my life. For example when I cook and make new things in the kitchen. I am an expert at combining whatever I find in the fridge into mostly palatable items. Although, sometimes my experiments don&apos;t turn out too well. Yesterday I mixed Polish blood sausage from Greenpoint with some Kimchi that I got from Flushing. Kimchi is a great thing to cook with by the way, it is wonderful when cooked up with some pork or bacon.

     Challenge is what keeps me going. If it is not challenging to some degree than it can be boring. I need the challenge in order to feel some sense of accomplishment when I complete the task/project/etc... Also, the challenge of not knowing what you are doing when you start a new language/job/relationship and figuring it out as you go along excites me. Also, DBC is the most challenging thing I have done in a long time. It is pushing my brain in weird directions it hasn&apos;t been pushed in a long time. Every time I finish a week&apos;s work (usually bleary eyed in the wee hours of Monday morning) I know that I accomplished something.

     Independence is what keeps me sane. I need my space and independence to do what I like/want to do and can&apos;t stand people breathing down my neck all the time. I moved out of the house after high school and haven&apos;t looked back. Independence leads nicely to...

     Adventure is the spice of life. There is a big, interesting world out there, might as well see some of it.  I love exploring a place and coming upon something amazing, fascinating, or beautiful. On saturday for example I had a mini-adventure and I followed a student&apos;s advice (I am an adult ESL Teacher (a profession which has allowed me to be independent and travel the world (more about that another time (in another blog (in more deeply nested parentheses)))) and went to the Canteen in the basement of a Hindu Temple here in Queens. Not only was it a food adventure where we had two kinds of Masala Dosas,  Samosas and Mango Lassis, the kind folks there were also quite gracious and welcoming in letting us check out the beautifully decorated temple. Come check it out if you are in this corner of Queens; <a href="https://nyganeshtemple.org/canteen"id="logoLink"><strong>The Canteen of the Hindu Temple Society of North America.</strong></a>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
     After writing about and contemplating this subject for a while I feel that all of these traits are fairly closely related. Searching for adventure is what got me to move out of the house after high school, but it also made me independent and value it as something important to me. Part of the reason I like travel and adventure is the challenge of surviving in a new place. Creativity is what has allowed me to find answers to my problems and also fueled my adventures. Part of being creative is knowing that there are different world views and seeking out different perspectives. Traveling and adventure has been part of this process of seeking out different perspectives.
