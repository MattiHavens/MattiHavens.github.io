<p>I reviewed three very different websites http://www.wimdelvoye.be/, https://www.spotify.com/us/, and http://www.fifa.com/</p> 
<p>The Delvoye website has a design which encourages the visitor to move all over the site and really explore it. From the wireframe you can see the "all-over" kind of design as well as the sidebar images which allow the visitor to view details as desired. The design ultimately encourages interaction from the viewer.</p>

<p>The FIFA website has a more utilitarian scroll-down site, which encourages the visitor to click on various boxes for more info. On the included wireframe you can see the brackets with spaces included for the flags of each country as they progress through the tournament. The other rectangles are for times and dates of each match. The long dark grey rectangle on top is a nice, clickable box which allows the visitor to find more details. The wireframe is definitely more complex.</p>

<p>The spotify website includes images in the background and smaller rectangles and boxes that the visitor can click on. Like the FIFA site it encourages the user to scroll-down. The option to download Spotify is always prominently visible on the top to encourage the visitor to do so. This is crucial for the wireframe design and this element must always remain static floating on top.</p>
