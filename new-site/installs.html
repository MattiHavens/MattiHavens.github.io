              <p>An installation made of 500 meters of wood that aggressively filled the space with two sizes of tetrahedrons. These tetrahedrons were placed on each other and the architecture to create a traversable and complex environment. Viewers were allowed to navigate their way through the piece and ascend the stairs to the balcony to view the piece from above.

         <p> I took the word &quot;one&quot; and found its synonyms from the Encarta World English Thesaurus. I then found the synonyms for those four words and continued the exponentially growing process of finding synonyms until I had five generations of words with approximately 1300 words total. In addition, I presented a history of the written word "one," as it develops through calligraphy, typewritten text to handwritten post-it notes. The synonyms literally evolve through each generation as they are presented down the wall.  
         </p>
         <p>The words are written, printed and typed from the top of the wall to the bottom in the following media. The first row is the word &quot;one&quot; hand written in calligraphy, the second row has four words printed using a printing press, the third row is typed with a typewriter, the fourth row is typed with a computer and the last row is hand written on post-it notes. Calligraphy was a beautiful and time consuming process, the privilege of an elite, educated few. Each subsequent generation of text presented on the wall took less time and energy to produce, allowing for the faster circulation of ideas. The exception is the post-it notes, which return to the process of hand written text.

               <p>A motion detector was placed outside by the train tracks that run adjacent to the building. As the train passed it would set into motion the toy train in the gallery, which used to be the entrance area for the obsolete train station. There was also a live microphone placed by the train tracks connected to the speakers in the gallery, so when a train went by it would bring the train noise into the gallery. The rocks and dirt are from the train tracks and form a protective barrier around the piece.

              <p>The piece has four bicycles connected to each other; one wheel to the next.  I had intended these bicycles to power a Super 8mm projector, however due to technical issues it did not function as I intended. I therefore decided to make it a performance piece, awarding trophies to those who rode for the longest and shortest times. As the piece was used it would break necessitating constant repair during its exhibition. It was also very noisy and entertaining to watch people get involved in this absurd competition.

                    The title is an equation for each line that can be adjusted depending upon the angle associated with that line and the radius of the circle created by all the tangents. x and y are dependent upon the position of the pattern relative to the walls in the space. In this piece the radius is 18&quot; and the angle between successive tangents is 4 degrees to make a total of 90 pieces of yarn. From above this geometric pattern can be clearly observed. The trapezoidal architecture of the space causes the sculpture to make pyramidal volumes. For a smooth color transition, the colors are arranged with the neighboring colors in the following manner (each letter represents a different color):  
                    AA B A BB C B CC D C, etc.
